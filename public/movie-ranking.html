<h1>The Best Animes According to Alan</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Animes of all the time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Shingeki No Kyojin</h3>
<p>This one of mi favorites anime of all the time, is for the nostalgic that i had with the characters
because i remember see the livestream of the first episode when i was in secondary school and i end the
final season when i am in university.</p>

<h3>Boku No Hero</h3>
<p>The main history end so bad, but the develop of the characters how they were involved was so amazing
I feel emphaty for the villans and the heroes and really i had chicken skin with the epic fights.</p>

<h3>Made in Abyss</h3>
<p>I love that how the anime is represented like a beautiful history and art but the history is so dark
    and sadness.</p>
